# About game versions
The web version of the modloader gives you some control over which version of google snake you are playing.

These versions will be quite similar, although there is the benefit that it will be possible to play on mods that haven't been updated to the latest version of the game.

version 1 - Latest version of Dice count             
version 2 - Shield mode added
