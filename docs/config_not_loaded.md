# Errors with loading configuration

The mod loader might show an error message saying that it "failed to load external configuration".

This refers to the configuration file here:
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DarkSnakeGang/GoogleSnakeModLoader/main/build/mod-info.json

If you don't have access to that page (for example if it has been blocked, or your internet is down), then unfortunately the mods won't work for you.

If this issue persists, please raise an [issue](https://github.com/DarkSnakeGang/GoogleSnakeModLoader/issues)
