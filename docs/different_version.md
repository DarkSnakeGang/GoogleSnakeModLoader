# Different Version of snake

If you are reading this, and the google snake mods aren't working, then you'll need to do one of the following workarounds (there is a chance that these fixes may not solve the issue):

1. Try playing snake on a different url. For example -  
https://www.google.ca/fbx?fbx=snake_arcade  
https://www.google.de/fbx?fbx=snake_arcade  
https://www.google.it/fbx?fbx=snake_arcade
2. Run the mods in incognito mode. You'll need to first allow tampermonkey to run in incognito mode - [see here for how to do this](https://www.howtogeek.com/702123/how-to-enable-an-extension-in-chromes-incognito-mode/).
Then go to incognito mode (ctrl+shift+n on chrome) and play snake there.
3. Download and run the mods in another browser.
4. Download and run the mods in a different chrome profile.

## Explanation of why the workaround is needed

Some people are getting a slightly different version of snake. This is likely because Google are running some sort of experiment.
The google snake mods won't work with this version of snake, so you'll need to do one of the above steps in order to get the "main" version of snake.
It seems random who gets this version of snake, and you may find that you get the different version on some days, but not on others.
You may get the different version in "normal" mode, but not in incognito/private mode.
You may get the different version in one chrome profile, but not another.
