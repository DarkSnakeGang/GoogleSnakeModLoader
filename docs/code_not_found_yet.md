# Potential issue with the snake code not being found

After 20s seconds, if the modloader hasn't yet found the snake code then it will show a message saying that the snake code hasn't been found.

1. This may happen if it is very slow to load (for example, you have bad internet connection).
2. It may also happen if Google has changed the location of the Google Snake code. This will mean that the snake mods won't work.

If case 2 happens, you should let us know by raising an [issue](https://github.com/DarkSnakeGang/GoogleSnakeModLoader/issues) about it. We will then be able to release an update to correct for whatever change has happened.
