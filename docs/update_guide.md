# How do I update the Google Snake Mod Loader

## How to update on newer versions of the mod loader

If you're on one of the more recent versions, you'll see a link here which you can then click on to update (this link won't appear if it's already up-to-date). This should open a new page where you can confirm the update. 
You'll need to refresh snake in order to get the updated version of the mod to run.

## How to update on the older versions of the mod

If you don't see the link, then you'll need to reinstall the mod by clicking on one of the below links and confirming it.
It's VERY important that you get the same version of the mod loader that you originally got. If you are unsure which version you have, you can see this by going on snake and clicking on the tampermonkey extension icon (somewhere around the top right on chrome, the version will show in brackets).
