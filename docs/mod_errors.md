# Why do mods sometimes not work?

2024 note: We now have a site for mods where they will always work.
https://googlesnakemods.com/

Sometimes, the mods will break when google make changes to the code for snake.
This may affect only some of the google snake mods or it may affect all of them.

We will try to fix the snake mods whenever this happens.
This typically can take a few days depending on how busy we are and how broken the mods are.

Note that the mods will still be playable on https://googlesnakemods.com/ which stores older versions of the game.
